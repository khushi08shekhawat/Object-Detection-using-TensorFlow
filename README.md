# Object-Detection-using-TensorFlow

This project focuses on building an object detection model using TensorFlow and OpenCV. It demonstrates how to detect and locate multiple object classes in images using bounding boxes. The model is trained on a custom dataset from Kaggle.

## üß∞ Features

- Detects multiple object classes (e.g., person, dog, vehicle)
- Trained using TensorFlow and Keras on a custom dataset
- Uses bounding box annotation (YOLO/Pascal VOC format)
- Annotated with OpenCV for live or static image prediction
- Easily extendable for new classes or datasets
